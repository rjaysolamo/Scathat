# ScanX

Your AI-powered shield that stops smart contract scams before they happen.
Fast. Real-time. Onchain security for everyone.


 The Problem

Billions lost yearly to hacks, rugpulls, and malicious approvals


Users can’t read or understand smart contracts


Builders move fast and skip security


Wallets warn users too late


Current auditing tools are slow, expensive, and reactive


People only realize they were hacked after pressing confirm.
ScanX fixes this.

The Solution
ScanX

AI that analyzes smart contracts in real time and protects users before they sign.
What it does:
Scans contracts instantly


Detects risky patterns, rugpull logic, and hidden exploits


Shows a simple “Safe / Warning / Dangerous” risk score


Uses AgentKit to:


Block unsafe transactions


Limit approvals


Auto-withdraw or pause interactions


Guide new users safely through onchain actions


Security you don’t have to understand  just trust.

User submits contract address → via web app or extension


Backend fetches bytecode + source from Basescan


Python AI engine sends contract to Venice.ai → gets risk score


Backend writes risk score to Base via a minimal smart contract


Dashboard shows results (safe{Green}, warning{Orange}, critical{Red})


AgentKit : auto-pause or block risky interactions
