 * @title RiskRegistry
 * @dev On-chain data labeling contract for storing and managing smart contract risk assessments.
 * 
 * This contract serves as a public registry where:
 * - Owner and authorized writers can publish/update risk scores
 * - Anyone can read risk scores for any smart contract address
 * - Risk scores are immutable once written (can only be updated by owner)
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Security scanners publishing risk analysis results
 * - AI engines storing contract safety scores
 * - Auditing tools storing verification results
 * - Risk management systems maintaining contract ratings
